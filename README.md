==========================================

### Description:
This is a smiple Arduino based game created for fun.
Based upon below configs.

1. The code uses LedControl library which is used for 8x8 led based on 7219IC.
2. For remote wifi and controlling the joystick using mobile this uses Blynk
   library setup.
3. Need working wifi connection (duh?)

If you can dare, this is a great way to destroy your Arduino ;)

### TODO:-
1. Fix this by giving some option to user.
2. No Game score added.
3. Add more game levels by increasing speed.
4. Let stars also provide a deflection to ball instead of we passing it
   through.
5. Add more game options to select??

### To compile:  Use Arduino software

### Contribution/Queries:-
1. In case if anyone would like to implement above TODOS or improve anything in
   this code, please feel free to submit a pull request.
2. Feel free to ask.
